    <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
    <p>My name is Cole Pergerson and I develop games using Unity3D. Iâ€™ve been pursuing game development for three years and much of what I have learned has been self taught. I create experiences that bring people together by challenging the meaning
      of friendship. My process begins with the experience which I then use as a foundation for the gameplay mechanics. My work is inspired by our highly connected but strangely disconnected world. The most popular multiplayer games today use people
      as content which leads to toxic and antisocial behavior. I want to solve this by shifting the players focus from themselves to people playing around them. I do this by blurring the lines between competition and cooperation such that the
      players are willing to sacrifice themselves for others. By bringing people together through games, I hope to encourage positive attitudes and social behavior among others.
