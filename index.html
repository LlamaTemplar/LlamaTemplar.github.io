    <h2>My name is Cole Pergerson</h2>
    <p>My name is Cole Pergerson and I develop games using Unity3D. I am applying to digital media art to further my ability to analyze experiences and convey them in my games. I develop games because I want to be able to create experiences and share them with others. I want to bring people together by blurring the lines between competition and cooperation. I will do this by creating an experience that will challenge the playerâ€™s meaning of friendship. My games start with the experience and I use that as a foundation for my gameplay mechanics. </p>
