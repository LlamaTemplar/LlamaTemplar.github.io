        <h3>Algae Bandit</h3>
        <p>
            A game about being a rogue crab who has chosen to steal food from other crabs. 
            As the player, you get to choose how you want to steal food from crabs, by 
            either using stealth or beating up any crab in the way. The game is an 
            exploration of evil in a fun and goofy setting. This game was developed 
            during the summer of 2020 and was part of the game dev best practices 
            workshop, which was hosted by the Game Dev Club at SJSU.

        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>
            The core gameplay loop of the game is collecting algae that is usually guarded 
            by other crabs. The movement mincks the locomotion of crabs by making sideway 
            movement faster. The crab is rotated by 90 degrees to allow for the control to 
            feel initiative, although this still made the movement unconventional which I 
            will explain later. The player can attack using either the left or right arm 
            of the crab. The goal of the game is to collect all the algae in the level. 
            The player can navigate to each algae but they must be tactical when thinking 
            about how they will approach another crab. When the player approaches a crab, 
            they must be careful to not expose their back because it’s defenseless. The 
            player can block attacks in front of them but they have limited block stamina.

        <h3>Level Design</h3>
        <p>
            I designed all the levels in the game. My design process started with creating 
            some interesting pathways. I would create different layouts in Unity until I 
            found one that could possibly create some unique challenges for the player. 
            Once the layout was finished, I would try to predict the player’s pathway and 
            create challenges along the way. If I felt that the pathways to each piece of 
            algae was too easy, I would set more challenges for the player. Once done, I 
            would test the level and repeat the process until I was happy with it. 
        </p>
        <h3>Concept and Design Decisions</h3>
        <p>
            The idea of the game was inspired by the Lybia edmondsoni crab, also known as 
            the boxer crab. It is a small crab that has stinging sea anemone on its claws. 
            The anemone resembles boxing gloves and it is quite humorous when the crab is 
            fighting another fish or crab.
            <br><br>
            The unconventional movement was also based on the movement of the crab. This 
            was a decision that took about a month of prototyping different ideas of 
            movement. We were set on the crab-like movement earlier on but it took awhile 
            to figure out how we should orientate the camera and make the controls as 
            initiative as possible.
