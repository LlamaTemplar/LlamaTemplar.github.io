            <h1>Recognizing Game Modders as Co-Creators</h1>
            <hr>
            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                An advantage that PC gamers have over Console gamers isn’t better graphics or using the mouse and keyboard, 
                it’s access to free community-made content for games. This free content is known as a mod and can be downloaded
                from the internet and installed into the game files. Mods are short for modification or hack and are changes
                in code or assets that alter the game. This paper will analyze different mods and what motivates people to
                volunteer their time to modify a game. I make the argument that modders should be considered as co-creators
                    and their work should be embraced. To support this claim, I highlight different mods made by my fans and
                    artist as well as my own mod that I created for this paper.

            </p>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                For those who are unfamiliar with game modding, a game mod is a modification to a game that is typically 
                made by someone who isn’t the original developer. There are different types of mods that require different 
                levels of skill and access to the source code. Mods that change textures and/or 3D models are considered 
                as custom texture packs or skins (new models that replace the old ones). Community patches are changes to 
                the source code that fix bugs or introduce new features. The most ambitious mods are total conversions 
                which make changes across the whole game to the point where the mod is vastly different from the original game. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Modders are fans that see an opportunity to make a change in game and do it by modifying the game. Most of them
                are modding a game they like out of passion in their own free time. When they finish a mod, they release it
                to the community for others to download and act as free downloadable content for the game. Sites like ModBD,
                Steam Workshop, and Nexus are popular mod repositories. Minecraft has a huge modding community which has
                    kept players playing the game long after its release. One interesting modification to the creative sandbox
                    game is JurassiCraft, which adds a bunch of dinosaurs and other game systems. The dinosaurs are unique
                    mobs added to the game with their own 3D models in the style of minecraft. Battlefront III Legacy mod
                    tries to create the promises of the cancelled Star Wars: Battlefront III game into Star Wars: Battlefront
                        II (2005). Generally games release a sequel to a popular game with better graphics and more gameplay
                        features. Star Wars fans were sad to hear that there was a Battlefront sequel in the works but was
                        canceled. A few fans took matters into their own hands by trying to recreate the gameplay they saw
                        in the canceled sequel. BattleFront III Legacy is a total conversation mod that adds new maps that
                            push the old game engine to its limits as well as new characters and gamemodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those were only some of the many great examples of modding. Modders don’t shy away from ambition
                (which is why most mods are unfinished) and are willing to put their free time into creating new content.
                One study interviewed a modding community for Operation Flashpoint (2001-2002), a first person military
            simulator game, and tried to understand their motivations and practices for creating mods. The study
            categorized three motivation factors for modders that can translate to most modding communities.
            First modders were motivated by artistic and creative goals, second to increase their enjoyment with a game,
            and lastly to use their experience to get a job in the gaming industry. Many mods for OFP were created by
            a team of people who had their own specializations such as scripting, modeling, texturing, and music. Members
            volunteer in their free time and teams adopt an open-source ethos by allowing others outside of the team to
            contribute to their projects. One of the largest mod teams may as well be SkyBlivion, a mod for Elder Scrolls:
            Skyrim (2011) that is recreating an older game Elder Scrolls: Oblivion (2006). The team has over 50 volunteers
            of different disciplines such as programmers, 3d modelers, texture artists, and more. Essentially they’re
                remastering an older game by porting in models from Oblivion and using the mod tools of skyrim to recreate
                all the quests, characters, mechanics, and other parts of the game. None of them are being paid by Bethesda,
                the developer of the Elder Scrolls games, yet this team functions like a developer studio. With this amount
                of labor and genuine passion, would these modders be considered as co-creators of the Skyrim?
            </p>
            <p>
                Artists are modding games and they claim those mods as their own artwork. Rafael Fajardo’s Crosser (2000),
                a mod of Frogger (1981), changes the art of the game to resemble the US-Mexico border. Fajardo uses
                Frogger’s mechanics and his own artwork to expose the harsh conditions of crossing the border for
                immigrants trying to find a better life. The player starts in Mexico and must first cross the Rio
                    Grande River which is filled with junk and dead bodies. In the middle is a border wall with security.
                    If the player can pass those, and finally a freeway full of cars, they can make it to the end of the game.
                    Fajardo collaborated with other artists to create this work and has exhibited the game to many museums. 

            </p>
            <h3>My Mod</h3>
            <p>
                Now allow me to add my own mod to the discourse. I’ve created a mod for the game Civilization 5 (2010) that adds
                a new civilization, the Transhumanist Society (Fig. 1). For those who are unfamiliar with that game, Civ 5 is
                a historic turn-based strategy game about managing a civilization through the course of time. Players can
                build cities, research technologies, fight over nations, and more. Each playable civilization that comes
                    with a game has unique artwork, leaders, traits, and history. They also will have a special building 
                    and unit that gives them perks. I decided to create my own civilization using the mod tools that Fixas,
                    the developer studio, has proved to the community. 

            </p>
            <p>
                I created the Transhumanist Society, which isn’t a specific civilization like the United States or China.
                Rather transhumanism is a philosophy about embracing technological human enhancements. While I was building
                this mod, I was thinking about what would a nation be like if the whole population embraced human enhancements?
                How could I express that through Civ 5’s gameplay mechanics and what possibly could this mod say about Civ 5?
                    With these ideas in mind, I spent a few weeks reading community-made mod tutorials and troubleshooting my 
                    written code. It was amazing to see how much passion people had for helping others learn how to mod this
                    game and without them, I would have spent months trying to figure out how to make my mod.

            </p>
            
            <p>
                What I did was add new XML files to Civ 5 that told the game engine to add a new civilization and load in
                all of my custom artwork. The process for that was tricky since the new files had to have correct syntax
                and couldn’t conflict with others. After a while of trial and error, I managed to get my new civilization
                added to the game and the feeling was great! I played a full game with the Transhumanist Society without
                    any issues and if I were to tweak a few more things, I could release the mod online for others to download and play. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I’ve essentially created new downloadable content (DLC) for Civ 5. Firaxis likely follows my same process for creating
                a new civilization to the game. After Civ 5 was released, Firaxis later added additional civilizations to the game
                as paid DLC. On Steam, an online game store for PC, the Civ and Scenario Pack: Korea adds Korea as a playable
                civilization and sells for $4.99.  Although this is a modification to the base game, this is considered a “mod”
                    since it’s made and released by the developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if the Korea DLC isn’t considered a mod, the Transhumanist Society mod questions if there is even a difference
                between what I created and what the developers have made. I personally feel that I have become a co-creator of Civ 5,
                even if I’m not legally one. Firaxis is a developer that has embraced a modding community since the release of
                Civilization II (1996), so they’re aren’t against what I’ve created. It’s difficult, however, to know whether
                    Firaxis see the Civ modding community as co-creators.  Civilization II was the first game in the series to
                    include mod support because the lead designer, Brian Reynolds, added the support without the approval of his
                    bosses. Brian wanted to bring the joy of modding his favorite games to Civ 2 and later stated later in an
                    interview that the modding community “kept the franchise going strong for the full five years until the 
                    release of Civ3.” A modding community can significantly increase the longevity of a game but in this 
                    interview, Brian isn’t acknowledging the modders as co-creators, instead he is saying that modders 
                    increase the market value of the game.

            </p>
            <h3>The Impact of modders</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, studios can benefit financially from mods, but more importantly, modders can create new ways of playing
                a game that the original developers never made. This thinking has parallels to the instructional based scores
                created by Fluxus artists. Fluxus was an international conceptual art movement for creative open-ended
                performances that incorporated chance. Chancing being the space for the viewer to interpret and perform
                    Fluxus work as a co-creator. Games work in a similar fashion since a game doesn't work without someone
                    playing it. Furthermore, players can interact with a game however they like. John Cage, a prominent
                    Fluxus artist, said this kind of work requires artists to “give yourself up.” This means allowing
                    for the viewer to take part in some of the creation as a co-creator. In the gaming industry,
                        however, this idea is viewed as free labor that contributes to the monetary value of a game. The
                        co-creator viewpoint offers a new way of seeing that embraces modders as active agents in the
                        design and development of games. Instead of a consumer and producer divide, the relationship
                        between modders and the developers could be mutual as they build ideas off of each other.

            </p>
            <p>
                Not surprising, modding has already been a driving force in the gaming industry. Dota 2, Counter-Strike,
                and PLAYERUNKNOWN’S Battlegrounds all started as mods and eventually were funded by established studios.
                Those mods evolved into some of the most popular games played across the world. Modders were thriving 
                in the 1990s with games like Doom (1993) and Half-Life (1998) that had extensive modding tools. Id Software,
                the developers of Doom, started as modders. John Carmack, the lead programmer and advactor of open-source
                    software, led the initiative to make Doom open to modders. People could design their own levels or create
                    different spins off of the game such as recreating scenes in Star Wars. After the release of Doom II,
                    Camack pushed the company to open-source Doom to the public which was and still is a radical move
                    . Another great blessing to the modding community was Half-Life by Valve. Half-life used a modified
                    version of the Quake game engine that was built by Id Software which later became Valve's Source
                        engine. Half-Life quickly grew a modding community after its successful launch and more advanced
                        modding tools. Total conversion mods became popular such as Counter-Strike, which turned the FPS
                        sci-fi game into a slower modern warfare game. Valve hired the modders as employees and released
                        Counter-Strike: Source (2000) as an official game. Its later sequel, Counter-Strike: Global 
                        Offensive (2014) became one of the best selling games on Steam and has a huge presence in the eSports scene. 
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Modders will reimagine games in ways that the original developers would never have thought of and that is very
                important to foster. If there will be any significant change in the gaming industry, it will likely come from
                modders. Modders build out passion and that kind of work should be seen by the industry as collaboration
                rather than value. Games are about play and what is more fun than creating new rules and challenges?
                    Perhaps one day these economic barriers can be broken down and we could create true co-creation between
                    studios, artists, and fans. Until then, keep modding!
