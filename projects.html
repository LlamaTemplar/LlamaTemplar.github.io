        To The Light is a 2D game based on the experience of waking up, as a child, from a nightmare and running through the dark to your parents room. I choose this experience because it’s one of the few childhood memories that really stand out for me. The most distinctive parts of my memory was turning on the lights as I went to my parents room. I turned that into the core mechanics of To The Light. The player must travel through the game by turning on the room and hallway lights in order to avoid the monster. The monster can threaten the player by turning off any light that the player is not in. Areas of safety change dramatically and the player must use timing and long term planning to complete each level.

      <p>Explore new worlds and solve problems along the way in NetGalaxy. The interactive piece challenges the user’s determination to never give up. The events in NetGalaxy present an issue, a set of items that need to be addressed, and a text
        box. It is up to the user to figure out how they will solve the problem, the only requirement is that they include all the items that need to be addressed. This experience was based on my fear of never being good enough for a programming
        job. I consider myself an experienced programmer, however, the job descriptions still haunt me. As I was working on NetGalaxy, I realized that my willingness to fight for what I wanted matter the most.

      <p>Make your way through the dungeon one item at a time. In MiniRogue, there are four items, each with their own unique purpose, that you will need to use to progress through each level. You can only hold one item at a time, so you'll need to
        decide which item is best for the situation you're in.

        My AR project consists of a small trigger image printed on paper and a gif that overlays the trigger. I was inspired by wealth inequality and the effects of globalism. I wanted the viewer to feel the growning financial instability of middle
        and lower class
        Americans. I was influenced by Scott Galloway who does economical analysis on YouTube. Galloway talks about the winners and losers in the current economy but also goes into the effects they have on people.

      <p>Everyone relies only on a couple companies in their everyday life. The apps that Facebook, Amazon, and Google offer have become irreplaceable to us. It’s hard to imagine what life would be like with these Silicon Valley tech companies,
        however this discussion has been growing. Institutions are catching on to the power that the companies have on our lives and the economy. </p>
      <p>With my video installation, I wanted to tie in religion with the big tech companies. Facebook, Amazon, and Google are the subjects of this piece because they’re the most influential companies in our everyday lives. The church is meant to
        convey the grand scale of the three companies. I wanted the viewer to think about the power the three companies have and how they would live without them. </p>

      <p>It's well known that apps in our phone collect data about us, but do you know how much data is being collected and how often? This was the question that inspired the creation of this video along with this article. Tech companies are usually
        very vague when describing how they use your data and I'm not surprised. Take a moment to think about what you do on the internet and try to imagine how companies like Google might use those footprints you leave behind. Sure they record what
        ads you click on or what you search, but what is stopping them from tracking your patterns and behaviors? What's stopping them from checking your location ten times a minute and then comparing the data you browse on the internet to the
        places you travel to?
