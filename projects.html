      <p>To The Light is based on the experience of waking up, as a child, from a nightmare and running through the dark to your parents room. I choose this experience because it’s one of the few childhood memories that really stand out for me. Horror is such a strong feeling that it can stay with you for years. The most distinctive parts of my memory was turning on the lights as I went to my parents room and thinking I saw dark figures in the corner of my eye. I turned those into the core mechanics of To The Light. The player is safe in light while the monster can lerk in the darkness. The monster can turn off lights that the player is not present in which changes where the player can go.</p>

      <p>Explore new worlds and solve problems along the way in NetGalaxy. The interactive piece challenges the user’s determination to never give up. The events in NetGalaxy present an issue, a set of items that need to be addressed, and a text box. It is up to the user to figure out how they will solve the problem, the only requirement is that they include all the items that need to be addressed. This experience was based on my fear of never being good enough for a programming job. I consider myself an experienced programmer, however, the job descriptions still haunt me. As I was working on NetGalaxy, I realized that my willingness to fight for what I wanted matter the most.

      <p>Grungeon was one of the 1,040 submissions for itch.io's biggest game jam of 2018, Game Maker's Toolkit Jam 2018</p>
      <p>This game was created by me and my friend Thomas Zakharzhevskiy using Unity3d. The challenge of the game jam was to design a game of the genre of our choice but remove a fundamental gameplay mechanic of that genre. Our game was a roguelike
        where you couldn’t die and it sounded easy at first. </p>
      <p>The game consistent of procedural generated levels and three different enemies that were programmed by Thomas. All the visuals, animations, and UI were all created by me. In order to win the game, you had to traverse up the dungeon to find
        the key to unlock the escape door while being attacked by goblins. We realized, after the intense 48 hours, that removing death is extremely difficult because you have to redefine the whole game. Instead of dieing, the player just fell all
        the way down to the bottom which was basically death. After reflecting on the design, I felt inspired to think outside of the box and create new mechanics. </p>
      <p>Grungeon is now on display at the KALEID gallery in downtown San Jose. </p>

      <p>Make your way through the dungeon one item at a time. In MiniRogue, there are four items, each with their own unique purpose, that you will need to use to progress through each level. You can only hold one item at a time, so you'll need to decide which item is best for the situation you're in.

        My AR project consists of a small trigger image printed on paper and a gif that overlays the trigger. I was inspired by wealth inequality when thinking about what my project but I then I changed my focus to the effects of globalism.
        Asetheticaly, I was striving for my project to resemble modern business marketing ads. They usually consist of dark cool colors and depict some feeling of prosperity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Globalism has brought new products and ideas together from around the world, however, it has amplified an unequal balance in wealth and power. I wanted the viewer to feel the growning financial instability of middle and lower class
        Americans. I was influenced by Scott Galloway who does economical analysis on YouTube. Galloway talks about the winners and losers in the current economy but also goes into the effects they have on people.

      <p>Everyone relies only on a couple companies in their everyday life. The apps that Facebook, Amazon, and Google offer have become irreplaceable to us. It’s hard to imagine what life would be like with these Silicon Valley tech companies,
        however this discussion has been growing. Institutions are catching on to the power that the companies have on our lives and the economy. </p>
      <p>With my video installation, I wanted to tie in religion with the big tech companies. Facebook, Amazon, and Google are the subjects of this piece because they’re the most influential companies in our everyday lives. The church is meant to
        convey the grand scale of the three companies. I wanted the viewer to think about the power the three companies have and how they would live without them. </p>

      <p>It's well known that apps in our phone collect data about us, but do you know how much data is being collected and how often? This was the question that inspired the creation of this video along with this article. Tech companies are usually
        very vague when describing how they use your data and I'm not surprised. Take a moment to think about what you do on the internet and try to imagine how companies like Google might use those footprints you leave behind. Sure they record what
        ads you click on or what you search, but what is stopping them from tracking your patterns and behaviors? What's stopping them from checking your location ten times a minute and then comparing the data you browse on the internet to the
        places you travel to?
      </p>
      <p>
        You could turn off your location and internet while traveling, but is that really worth it? The amount of data that is being collected from my phone is probably scary but I don't really care. That is the price I pay for using free services
        that have helped me get around and discover new people.
